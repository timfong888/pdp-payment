## Overview

PDP-Payments (FWS) is a comprehensive system for Provable Data Possession (PDP) with integrated payment mechanisms for Filecoin storage providers and clients. It is designed to enhance the Filecoin storage network by providing:

1. **Verifiable Storage**: Cryptographic proofs that storage providers are maintaining client data
2. **Automatic Payments**: Configurable payment channels with adjustments based on proof compliance
3. **SLA Enforcement**: Service Level Agreements enforced through arbitration mechanisms
4. **Continuous Payment Flow**: Payments that flow as long as storage services are properly provided

This documentation repository serves as a central resource for understanding how the various components of the PDP-Payments (FWS) system work together.

## Getting Started

### üöÄ Choose Your Path to Success

**What do you want to build?**

#### üì± **Developer Path: Build Apps Fast** (Recommended)
Use the [Synapse SDK](https://github.com/FilOzone/synapse-sdk) for rapid development with integrated PDP + Payments:

**‚ö° 5-Minute Hello World**
1. **[Setup Wallet & USDFC](docs/setup.md)** - Get testnet tokens (shared setup)
2. **[Quick SDK Setup](docs/sdk/sdk-quickstart.md)** - Install and initialize Synapse SDK
3. **[Complete Workflow](docs/sdk/sdk-workflow.md)** - Store file + handle payments in ~20 lines
4. **[Monitor & Verify](docs/sdk/sdk-monitoring.md)** - Track storage proofs and payments

**üí° Why SDK?** Abstract away complexity - automatic payment escrow, built-in settlement, simple balance management.

#### ü§ñ **AI Agent Path: Maximum Control** (Advanced)
Direct contract interactions for full technical control:

**üîß Technical Deep Dive**
1. **[Setup Wallet & USDFC](docs/setup.md)** - Get testnet tokens (shared setup)
2. **[Blockchain Configuration](docs/setup-detailed.md)** - JSON-RPC, Viem patterns, environment setup
3. **[Contract Integration](docs/contracts-guide.md)** - Direct PDP and Payment contract calls
4. **[Advanced Patterns](docs/examples/hot-vault.md)** - Production-ready examples
   - **[Traditional Hot Vault](docs/examples/hot-vault.md)** - Reference implementation with Docker
   - **[Modern Wagmi-Vercel Hot Vault](docs/examples/wagmi-vercel-hotvault.md)** - Serverless Web3 app with Wagmi v2

**üéØ Why Contracts?** Full control over every transaction, custom logic, advanced error handling.

### üìö Deep Dive Documentation

Once you've completed the Golden Path:

1. Understand the [PDP System](docs/pdp-overview.md) and [Payments System](docs/payments-overview.md)
2. Learn how to [Integrate PDP with Payments](docs/integration-guide.md)
3. Explore advanced [Integration Patterns](docs/integration/pdp-payments.md)

## Synapse SDK

The **Synapse SDK** is the primary interface for developers to interact with the PDP-Payments system. It provides a simple JavaScript/TypeScript API that abstracts away the complexity of direct contract interactions.

### Key Features

- **üéØ Simple API**: Store files in ~5 lines of code
- **üí∞ Integrated Payments**: Automatic USDFC handling and payment escrow
- **üîç PDP Verification**: Built-in storage proofs and verification
- **üì¶ TypeScript Support**: Full type safety and IntelliSense
- **‚ö° CDN Integration**: Optional CDN-accelerated file retrievals
- **üîÑ Real-time Monitoring**: Track storage status and payment settlements

### Quick Example

```javascript
import { Synapse } from 'synapse-sdk'

// Initialize SDK
const synapse = new Synapse({
  privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
  withCDN: true
})

// Store file with automatic payment handling
const storage = await synapse.createStorage()
const uploadTask = storage.upload(fileData)
const commp = await uploadTask.commp()
await uploadTask.done()
```

## Key Components

### PDP (Provable Data Possession)

The PDP system allows storage providers to prove they are still storing client data without having to retrieve the entire dataset:

- **PDPVerifier Contract**: Handles verification of proofs submitted by storage providers
- **SimplePDPService**: Implements SLA terms for proof frequency and requirements
- **Proof Sets**: Data structures tracking the data being proven, owner, and proof history

### Payments System

The payments system provides flexible payment channels between clients and storage providers:

- **Payment Rails**: Channels connecting payers and payees with configurable payment rates
- **Arbitration**: Third-party arbiters that modify payment amounts based on service delivery
- **Settlement**: Process ensuring payments are made according to agreed terms

### Integration

The integration between PDP and Payments enables:

- **Verifiable Storage with Automatic Payment Adjustments**: Payments adjusted based on proof compliance
- **SLA Enforcement**: Service Level Agreements enforced through arbitration
- **Continuous Payment Flow**: Payments flow as long as service is properly provided
