# AI Agent Task Management: PDP-Payments Documentation Project

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: This file is for AI agents working on documentation generation, not for developers using the system. Developers should start with the [README.md](../README.md).

## Overview
This task management file tracks the autonomous technical documentation generation for the PDP-Payments (FWS) system. The goal is to create comprehensive documentation that serves both new developers and AI agents, with a focus on the "Golden Path" to hello world success.

## Primary Objectives
- [ ] Generate comprehensive technical documentation for PDP-Payments system
- [ ] Create clear "Golden Path" for new developer onboarding
- [ ] Ensure documentation is AI agent-consumable (Context7 MCP compatible)
- [ ] Establish iterative loop: Code Analysis ‚Üí Documentation ‚Üí Review

## Notes and Observations

### Progress Update - Phase 2 Documentation Writing
**Date**: Current session
**Status**: Significant progress on Golden Path documentation

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Updated main README.md with improved Golden Path navigation
- ‚úÖ **Step 1**: Complete wallet setup guide with USDFC minting process
- ‚úÖ **Step 2**: Comprehensive JSON-RPC setup with connection testing
- ‚úÖ **Step 3**: Synapse SDK integration with file upload examples
- ‚úÖ **Step 4**: Modern Hot Vault demo with Wagmi v2 + Next.js 14 patterns

**Key Findings:**
1. **USDFC Integration**: Successfully documented the complete flow from tFIL faucet ‚Üí USDFC minting ‚Üí MetaMask setup
2. **JSON-RPC Endpoints**: Identified multiple reliable endpoints (Glif, Ankr, ChainupCloud) for Calibration testnet
3. **Synapse SDK**: Currently uses mock implementation but provides clear API patterns for future real implementation
4. **Modern Web3 Patterns**: Integrated latest Wagmi v2 hooks and Next.js 14 App Router patterns from MCP libraries
5. **Developer Experience**: Each step builds logically on the previous, with clear prerequisites and troubleshooting

**MCP Integration Success**: Successfully leveraged Context7 MCP server to get:
- Wagmi v2 hooks and patterns for wallet connection
- Next.js 14 App Router API route patterns
- Modern TypeScript patterns for contract interactions
- Real-world code examples from production libraries

**Strategic Pivot**: Based on Synapse SDK analysis, implementing dual-path architecture:

### üéØ **New Dual-Path Documentation Architecture**

**Key Discovery**: Synapse SDK includes full PDP + Payments integration, making it ideal for developer-focused documentation.

#### üì± **Developer Path (SDK-First)**: Complete PDP + Payments Workflow
- **Goal**: 5-minute hello world with integrated payments
- **Audience**: Developers who want to build apps quickly
- **Value**: ~20 lines of code vs 200+ with raw contracts
- **Focus**: SDK abstracts complexity of coordinating PDP proofs with USDFC payments

#### ü§ñ **AI Agent Path (Contract-Direct)**: Maximum Technical Control
- **Goal**: Full technical detail and contract-level control
- **Audience**: AI agents and advanced developers
- **Value**: Complete access to all contract functionality
- **Focus**: Direct Wagmi/Viem contract interactions with full technical detail

### ‚úÖ **Implementation Tasks**

#### Phase 2B: Dual-Path Implementation
- [x] **Create SDK Golden Path** (Developer-focused)
  - [x] Step 1: Quick SDK Setup (`docs/sdk-quickstart.md`)
  - [x] Step 2: Complete Storage + Payment Workflow (`docs/sdk-workflow.md`)
  - [x] Step 3: Monitor & Verify (`docs/sdk-monitoring.md`)
  - [x] Step 4: Production Deployment (`docs/sdk-production.md`) - **Updated with Vercel + React**

- [ ] **Reorganize Contract Path** (AI Agent-focused)
  - [ ] Move existing technical docs to AI Agent path
  - [ ] Create contract integration guide (`docs/contracts-guide.md`)
  - [ ] Create PDP technical implementation (`docs/pdp-technical.md`)
  - [ ] Create payment technical implementation (`docs/payments-technical.md`)

- [x] **Update Navigation & README**
  - [x] Clear path separation in README.md
  - [x] Update all cross-references
  - [x] Add value proposition for each path
